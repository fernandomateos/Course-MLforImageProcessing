# Introduction

In this section you will find information on course contents, requirements and resources.

The main **learning objectives** are to:

 - Understand the fundamentals of Machine Learning (such as the difference between supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning),

 - Understand a general Machine Learning modelling workflow,

 - Pre-process and pre-annotate images to accelerate ML projects,

 - Apply data augmentation techniques and

 - Build an image classification model with your own or example data.

<br/>

Attendees must have a good knowledge of the basic concepts and techniques of Python, including Python syntax, basic programming concepts and familiarity with Pandas and Numpy libraries – attendance at an introductory Python programming workshop or course or familiarity with another language software such as R is considered a suitable background for this course.

## Google Colab

For this course we will use Google Colab. Colab, or "Colaboratory", is a free, cloud-based environment similar to Jupyter’s network environment that allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser without the need for installation/configuration and it also provides free access to GPUs.

To start using Google Colab, you will need a Google account.

Then go to Google Colab's home page [here](https://colab.research.google.com/).

A home screen of Google Colab will appear and you can either open a new Python notebook, by clicking 'new notebook' on the bottom right corner, or click 'cancel' and go to a short tutorial on how to get started with Google colab.
