# Intro Practice: Basics of computer vision with Python

<br/>

This course uses a computer vision and ML image analysis framework described in detail in this [publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.29.498112v1.abstract).

This open-source modular framework for large scale image storage, handling, annotation and automatic classification, uses cost- and labour-efficient methodologies. The tool is based on [TensorFlow Lite Model Maker library](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker) and includes data augmentation and [transfer learning](https://books.google.pt/books?id=CLyDxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) techniques, [**AA: what is that? We did not define the term convolutional:** applied to different convolutional neural network models\*\*]\*\*

<br/>

In the introductory practice below we will use Python and computer vision libraries for basic image processing. The practice is done on Google Colab and you can access the notebook here:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qhc8kgXAwM3k18zgweAsvwIjSG0Qm8lT)

**Do people need to finish reading what is below to do the practice? Or do they do the practice first and then get back to reading what is below? If they need to finish reading first, then it is best to put the link at the bottom.**

One of the libraries we use is this model is [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). **This library is written in C++, but can be used in Google Colab and has a graphical interface? -- need to explain why this is needed and how it is different from other scripts. Is OpenCV is just a library of Python or is it a different software. Remember many people will come with R background, where modules ar called libraries?** will be used We will use basic functions to read and display images but if you would like to learn more about the library you can find a crash online course [here](https://opencv.org/opencv-free-course/).

We will also create a simple function to visualise images so if you would like to learn more about defining functions see [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp).
