# Intro Practice: Basics of computer vision with Python

<br/>

This course is using the framework below described in detail in this [publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.29.498112v1.abstract).

This open-source user friendly and modular framework for large scale image storage, handling, annotation and automatic classification, uses cost- and labour-efficient methodologies. The tool is based on [TensorFlow Lite Model Maker library](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker) and includes data augmentation and [transfer learning](https://books.google.pt/books?id=CLyDxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) techniques, applied to different convolutional neural network models.

<br/>

In this introductory practice we will use Python and computer vision libraries for basic image processing. You can access the notebook here:

<br/>

One of the libraries we will use is [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). We will use basic functions to read and display images but if you would like to learn more about the library you can find a crash online course [here](https://opencv.org/opencv-free-course/).

We will also create a simple function to visualise images so if you would like to learn more about defining functions see [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp).
