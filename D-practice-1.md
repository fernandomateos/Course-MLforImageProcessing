# Practice 1: Pre-processing images 

Framework step 2:

![Framework](./images/framework.png)

In this section we will pre-process images that may contain sensitive data, such as peopleâ€™s faces. Images collected by citizens or extracted from internet may contain sensitive data and depending on the nature of subsequent work (e.g. crowdsourced annotation of images), it may be preferrable to remove such data. In this practice we will use the function `detect_face()` of the Python library [CVlib](https://www.cvlib.net/) and the pre-trained model `caffemodel` to detect human faces. After face detection, a rectangle is drawn around the face and an overlay is applied to the image content inside the rectangle to remove sensitive data before further analyses.
