# Intro Practice: Basics of computer vision with Python

In this section we will use Python and computer vision libraries for basic image processing. You can access the notebook here:

 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/fishsizeproject/Course-MLforImageProcessing/blob/dev/3-intro-practice.ipynb)

<br/>

One of the libraries we will use is [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). We will use basic functions to read and display images but if you would like to learn more about the library you can find a crash online course [here](https://opencv.org/opencv-free-course/).

We will also create a simple function to visualise images so if you would like to learn more about defining functions see [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp).
