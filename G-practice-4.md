For this practice you need to be familiear with a few concepts that we have not introduced yet.

**Transfer learning** is commonly defined as a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, the knowledge gained while learning to recognize fishes could apply when trying to recognize clownfish. 

From a practical point of view, transferring information from a previously learned task (previously trained model) for the learning of new tasks (new models) has the potential to significantly improve efficiency of the learning process.
